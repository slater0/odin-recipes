        <h4>Description</h4>

            <p>
                This Vietnamese steak salad is served on a bed of greens and tomatoes, topped with pickled onions and a lime dipping sauce.
                It is a widely popular Asian dish that blends taste sensations to creates a harmony of flavor with every bite. 
                The "shaking" in the name refers to the tossing of the beef back and forth in the wok after it's quickly seared.
