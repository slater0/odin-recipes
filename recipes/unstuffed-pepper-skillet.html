        <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
            This unstuffed pepper skillet is much easier to make than actual stuffed peppers but packs just as much flavor. A super satisfying and delicious dish.

                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons hot cherry pepper hoagie spread (such as Cento)</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 (8.8 ounce) package microwavable white rice (such as Ben's), crumbled</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>

            </ul>
  
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add peppers and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Add beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Season with garlic and Italian seasoning and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, water, hoagie spread, and salt.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in rice until coated evenly with sauce.
                    Cover, reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer, and cook until rice and vegetables are tender, about 8 minnutes, stirring once halfway through to prevent sticking.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Uncover, remove from heat, and springle with shredded cheese.
                    Re-cover and let it sit until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot, sprinkled with basil or parsley.
                </li><br>
            </ol>
